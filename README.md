AWS Lambda Function for Deleting Unused EBS Snapshots
‚úÖ Project Description
This AWS Lambda function is designed to automatically identify and delete unused Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots. The goal is to optimize storage costs by removing stale snapshots that are no longer associated with any active EC2 volumes or running instances.

üî• Features
Automated Cleanup: Identifies and deletes EBS snapshots that are not linked to any volume or are linked to deleted volumes.

Cost Optimization: Frees up unused storage, reducing unnecessary costs.

Efficient Execution: Uses AWS Lambda to run on a schedule (e.g., using Amazon EventBridge) for periodic cleanup.

Error Handling: Handles exceptions gracefully, including deleted or missing volumes.

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before deploying this Lambda function, ensure you have the following:

AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions.

IAM Role with the following permissions:

ec2:DescribeSnapshots

ec2:DescribeInstances

ec2:DescribeVolumes
